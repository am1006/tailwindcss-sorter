# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VS Code extension that sorts Tailwind CSS v4 classes using configurable regex patterns. Built for Ruby/Phlex, ERB, HTML, JSX, TSX, and Vue with user-configurable language support.

**Note: Only Tailwind CSS v4+ is supported.** Uses native sorting logic based on the official prettier-plugin-tailwindcss algorithm via Tailwind's `__unstable__loadDesignSystem` API.

## Commands

```bash
# Type checking
npm run check-types

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build (includes type check + lint)
npm run compile

# Production build
npm run package

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit
# (don't run the full test suite, just the unit tests)

# Compile tests only
npm run compile-tests
```

└── tailwindcss/    # Bundled Tailwind CSS files (copied from node_modules during build)
    ├── index.css   # Main entry point for @import "tailwindcss"

```

**Flow:** `extension.ts` → `config.ts` (get settings) → `matcher.ts` (find class strings via regex + class functions) → `sorter.ts` (sort using native tailwind module)

**Key design decisions:**
- Non-intrusive: `runOnSave` and `showDiagnostics` are OFF by default to avoid conflicts with other formatters
- `onWillSaveTextDocument` ensures sorting runs **before** formatters (format on save), so formatters get final say on code style
- Code action provider offers quick fixes only when classes need sorting
- Sorter instance is cached and only reinitialized when config changes (hash comparison)
- **Two-tier language config:**
  - `enabledLanguages`: simple array to pick which built-in languages to enable (empty = all)
  - `customLanguages`: add new languages or override built-in patterns
  - Logic: built-in → filter by enabledLanguages → merge customLanguages
- **Class functions matching:** The `classFunctions` setting allows global detection of utility functions like `cn()`, `merge()`, `twMerge()` etc. Uses balanced parenthesis tracking to find ALL string arguments within these function calls, handling nested calls, arrays, and conditional expressions.
- **Bundled Tailwind CSS:** The build process copies Tailwind CSS files (index.css, theme.css, preflight.css, utilities.css) from node_modules to dist/tailwindcss/. This allows the extension to work in VSIX packages where require.resolve() cannot access node_modules. The context.ts `loadStylesheet` function resolves `@import "tailwindcss"` and `tailwindcss/*` imports from these bundled files.

## Testing the Extension

Press F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host.

## Local Installation (without marketplace)

```bash
npm run package                    # Build for production
npx @vscode/vsce package           # Creates .vsix file
```

Then in VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." → select the `.vsix` file.
